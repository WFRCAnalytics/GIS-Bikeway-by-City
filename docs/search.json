This allows for direct comparison of roadway and bikeway infrastructure across municipalities.\nEach row represents a municipality, with columns for total road lane miles followed by columns for each bikeway facility type. Cities with zero bikeway miles for a particular facility type will show 0 in that column.\n\nShow the code# Combine with roads\ncombined_miles_by_city &lt;- road_miles_by_city |&gt;\n  # Convert road lane miles to numeric\n  dplyr::mutate(road_lane_miles = as.numeric(total_lane_miles)) |&gt;\n  dplyr::select(city_name, road_lane_miles) |&gt;\n  # Join with bikeway data\n  dplyr::right_join(bikeway_miles_by_city, by = \"city_name\") |&gt;\n  # Reorder columns: city_name, bike categories, total bike, then road\n  dplyr::select(\n    city_name,\n    dplyr::all_of(facility_levels),   # bike lane categories\n    total_bike_lane_miles,\n    road_lane_miles\n  )\n\ncombined_miles_by_city |&gt;\n  dplyr::arrange(dplyr::desc(road_lane_miles))\n\n# A tibble: 256 × 14\n   city_name        Cycle track, at-grade, protected wi…¹ Cycle track, protect…²\n   &lt;chr&gt;                                            &lt;dbl&gt;                  &lt;dbl&gt;\n 1 &lt;NA&gt;                                              0                     0    \n 2 Salt Lake City                                    2.53                  2.83 \n 3 St. George                                        0                     0    \n 4 West Valley City                                  0                     0    \n 5 West Jordan                                       0                     0    \n 6 Lehi                                              0                     1.88 \n 7 Sandy                                             0                     0    \n 8 South Jordan                                      0                     0.300\n 9 Layton                                            0                     0    \n10 Provo                                             0                     0.943\n# ℹ 246 more rows\n# ℹ abbreviated names: ¹​`Cycle track, at-grade, protected with parking (1A)`,\n#   ²​`Cycle track, protected with barrier (1B)`\n# ℹ 11 more variables: `Buffered bike lane (2A)` &lt;dbl&gt;, `Bike lane (2B)` &lt;dbl&gt;,\n#   `Cycle track, raised and curb separated (1C)` &lt;dbl&gt;,\n#   `Marked shared roadway (3B)` &lt;dbl&gt;, `Signed shared roadway (3C)` &lt;dbl&gt;,\n#   `Shoulder bikeway (3A)` &lt;dbl&gt;, `Other bike route, unspecified (3)` &lt;dbl&gt;, …\n\n\nKey Finding: The ratio of bikeway lane miles to road lane miles varies considerably across Utah municipalities, indicating different levels of investment in bicycle infrastructure relative to overall roadway networks."
